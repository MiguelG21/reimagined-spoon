# 📘 Algorithms and Data Structures in C++

Welcome to my personal C++ repository dedicated to implementing, and documenting **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving techniques**.

This repository is a **work in progress**, and I'm consistently adding more implementations, explanations, and optimizations. My goal is to:
- 📚 Deepen the understanding of fundamental and advanced topics in computer science
- 💻 Practice clean, well-documented C++ code
- 📘 Continuously improve the efficiencyc of my implementations
---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

This repository currently include implementations and explanations of the following concepts:

### 🔹 Data Structures
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stack and Queue
- Priority Queue (Heap - Max & Min)

### 🔹 Algorithms

### 🔹 Bit Manipulation

### 🔹 Recursion & Backtracking

### 🔹 Sliding Window & Two Pointers

### 🔹 Advanced Graph Algorithms

### 🔹 Dynamic Programming Patterns

### 🔹 Advanced Sorting

### 🔹 Tries (Prefix Trees)

### 🔹 Range Query Structures

### 🔹 Number Theory

### 🔹 Matrix Algorithms

### 🔹 Game Theory

### 🔹 Monte Carlo & Approximation

### 🔹 System Design & Scalability

## 🛠 Work in Progress

This repository is under active development — not all topics have been implemented yet. As I complete more implementations, I’ll update the list and documentation accordingly.

Feel free to explore the existing implementations, check back often for updates!
